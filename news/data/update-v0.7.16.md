This patch is a bit earlier than our typical patch time to prep for our Valorant release.
But it also contains an often-asked-for feature: local recording!
There are some limitations to local recording though.
Notably, you will not be able to see locally recorded matches in the "Recent VODs" newsfeed; however, you are able to view all your matches as per usual in the game logs.

## Features
* Ability to record to your computer locally and manually specify which VODs are uploaded to SquadOV later.

## Improvements
* Support for OpenGraph and Twitter Cards for our share links.
* Enabled the variable framerate option by default for everybody.

## Bug Fixes
* Additional fixes to hopefully fix Hearthstone crash.
* Show death recap and player info on WoW shared pages.
* Hopefully fix an issue that was causing some of our VOD processing instances to get stuck processing some VODs.
